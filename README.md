*A Generative AI-powered application for automated content creation, built with LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit.*  

---

## 📝 **Description**  
This project demonstrates the power of **Generative AI** in automating complex tasks like **context-aware text generation**, **question creation**, and **data structuring**. It leverages **LangChain**, **OpenAI API**, and **Streamlit** to build a scalable solution for educators, developers, and enterprise users.  

Key Use Cases:  
- Automated MCQ generation from PDF/text inputs.  
- Contextual text summarization.  
- Prompt engineering for domain-specific outputs.  

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**  
- **📂 File Upload**: Process PDF or TXT files for input text extraction.  
- **🎛️ Customization**: Define parameters like output format (MCQs, summaries), subject, and complexity.  
- **🧠 Intelligent Generation**: Use GPT models for accurate, pedagogically relevant outputs.  
- **📊 Interactive UI**: View results in a clean Streamlit dashboard.  
- **📝 Logging**: Track application events for debugging.

Okay, the user wants a GitHub README code based on the provided instructions. Let me start by understanding what they need.

First, looking at the user's input, they have specific steps for setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, configuring the OpenAI API key, running the app, and more. They also mentioned sections like Usage Guide, File Structure, Acknowledgments, Contributions, License, and Support. The user wants this in code format so they can directly paste it into their GitHub README.

I need to structure this into a Markdown file. Let me recall the standard sections of a README: Title, Description, Features, Installation/Setup, Usage, File Structure, Acknowledgments, Contributions, License, and Support. The user's input includes all these elements, so I'll map them accordingly.

The user provided code snippets for setup steps. I should format these as code blocks using triple backticks. Also, they want badges for license and maybe other metrics, but since they didn't specify, I'll include the license badge as in the previous example.

I need to ensure that the GitHub link is correct. The user mentioned modifying the GitHub link to their repository, so I'll use `https://github.com/pra9711/GEN-AI-IBM-PROJECT` as per their earlier message.

The user also included sections like Acknowledgments and Contributions, which should be written in a concise manner. I'll make sure those are included with appropriate headings.

I should check for any missing parts. For example, the original example had a "Getting Started" section with Prerequisites. The user's input includes Prerequisites under the Setup, so I'll integrate that.

The user's input has a section for Running the App and Usage Guide. These should be separate sections with clear instructions.

File Structure is important, so I'll list each file/directory and its purpose in a table for readability.

Finally, the License and Support sections need to be included, along with a link to the GitHub repository at the end.

I need to make sure that all code blocks are properly formatted and that the Markdown syntax is correct. Also, any special characters like underscores or asterisks should be escaped if necessary.

Putting it all together, the README should be clean, well-organized, and easy to follow for anyone contributing to or using the project. I'll start drafting each section step by step, ensuring that all user-provided content is included accurately.
Here’s a clean and well-structured README.md in Markdown format that you can directly copy-paste into your GitHub repository:
